## Getting Started

You will create a reddit feed web app from the reddit API.
Users must be able to search for any subreddit and get a list, limited to 100 results, of hot and
new topics.
For each topic will be displayed a maximum of 3 comments with a maximum of 5 replies.
Besides this requirement, you may decide what data is relevant to display or not.
No need to persist data in a database.
